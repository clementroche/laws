# [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)

Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.

# [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)
In economics, the Jevons paradox (/ˈdʒɛvənz/; sometimes Jevons' effect) occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that resource rises due to increasing demand. The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics. However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.

# [Brandolini's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law)
Brandolini's law, also known as the bullshit asymmetry principle, is an internet adage that emphasizes the effort of debunking misinformation, in comparison to the relative ease of creating it in the first place. It states that "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.
