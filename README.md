# 🧠 Laws, Principles & Paradoxes — A Mental Model of How the World Works

This repository is a curated collection of timeless laws, principles, effects, and paradoxes drawn from fields such as economics, psychology, computer science, and sociology.
Each entry distills a fundamental insight about how systems behave and how humans think, decide, and act.
Understanding these patterns helps build a richer mental model of the world, a toolkit for clearer reasoning, better decisions, and deeper insight into why people and systems behave the way they do.

## [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes (the “vital few”). Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.

## [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.

## [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)
In economics, the Jevons paradox (/ˈdʒɛvənz/; sometimes Jevons' effect) occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that resource rises due to increasing demand. The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics. However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.

## [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
The Dunning–Kruger effect is a hypothetical cognitive bias stating that people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.

## [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)
Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.

## [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)
Parkinson's law is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion".

## [Wirth's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law)
Wirth's law is an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.

## [Curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand. This bias is also called by some authors the curse of expertise.

## [Brandolini's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law)
Brandolini's law, also known as the bullshit asymmetry principle, is an internet adage that emphasizes the effort of debunking misinformation, in comparison to the relative ease of creating it in the first place. It states that "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.

## [Halo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect)
The halo effect (sometimes called the halo error) is the tendency for positive impressions of a person, company, brand, or product in one area to positively influence one's opinion or feelings in other areas. Halo effect is “the name given to the phenomenon whereby evaluators tend to be influenced by their previous judgments of performance or personality.” The halo effect is a cognitive bias which can possibly prevent someone from accepting a person, a product or a brand based on the idea of an unfounded belief on what is good or bad.

## [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)

## [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)
The Streisand effect is the way in which attempts to hide, remove, or censor information can lead to the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of that information.


## [Paris syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome)
Paris syndrome (in Japanese: パリ症候群, Pari shōkōgun) is a sense of extreme disappointment exhibited by many individuals when visiting Paris, who feel that the city does not live up to their expectations. The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of culture shock.[1] The cluster of psychiatric symptoms has been particularly noted among Japanese tourists, perhaps due to the way in which Paris has been idealized in Japanese culture.
